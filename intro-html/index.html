    </p>
    <ol>
        <li> Of course, the
            <strong> Fantastic Beast series</strong></li>
        <p> I recently watched <strong> Secrets of Dumbledore </strong></p>
        <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1o_MjaF_E2o/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Fantastic Beast">

        <li><strong> Detective series </strong></li>
        <p> I find the thrill particularly interesting. </p>
        <li> <strong> Free Guy </strong></li>
        <p> Interesting narration of story.

        <li><strong> Marvel </strong></li>
        <p> As cliche as it sounds, they are light hearted and relaxing. </p>
        <li><strong>Sad romance films </strong>
        </li>
        <p> Who doesn't like feeling sappy once in a while? </p>
    </ol>
